# Memo

Memo is a drop-down app to take note for KDE users. After started, you can trigger it at any time with the `F10` global keyboard shortcut.

The screenshot below was taken while using the [Materia KDE](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/materia-kde) theme. Other themes (especially white themes) may cause incorrect colors.
